# CF7-SalesMessage
 This WordPress plugin integrates Contact Form 7 with SalesMessage to send SMS notifications when a form is submitted. It uses OAuth2 for authentication and logs errors. The plugin extracts form data, checks for restricted values, and sends an SMS via SalesMessage API if valid. It also manages OAuth tokens, including access and refresh tokens, for future requests.
